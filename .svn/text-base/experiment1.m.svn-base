% This is an example file showing how to experiment the Bayesian Surprise Model
% Toolkit. In essence you will input bunch os samples each taken at a new
% time step. It is assumed that each sample is taken at a regular interval.
% The return value is the amount of "Surprise" given the stream of data
% given to the model.
