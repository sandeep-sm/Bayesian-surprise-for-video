************************************************

This is a basic readme to help you get started. For more information
see the web page listed above. 

This toolkit has been tested on Matlab versions 6.5 and 7.3 on Linux 
and Windows. It might run on ealier versions. However, it has not 
been tested on them. I suspect it will run fine on versions as early 
as 5.x. 

It is our desire that you not need any special matlab toolboxes to run 
this kit. If you discover that this is not the case, please email us. Also
feel free to send any bug reports to our sourceforge web page. 

There are two example files to get you started. There is example.m 
which shows a simple way to run the surprise model and 
example_graph.m which will give you a graph of surprise space. There
is also an experiment demo called experiment1.m . These should give
you enough to start with. 

For help on any function, the basic matlab help should work. Be sure
to include the toolkit and sub directories in your path. If this is
done, you can type for instance:

>> help runsm
   
This should bring up a standard matlab help.

This toolkit also contains several experiments. These can be 
activated using the options parameters. see newsm.m for a listing of
default and starting values.
